##  SSL Support
## ------------- 
##
## To enable SSL for the whole server you have to provide a valid
## certificate and have to enable the SSL engine.::
##
##   ssl.engine = "enable"
##   ssl.pemfile = "/path/to/server.pem"
##
## The HTTPS protocol does not allow you to use name-based virtual
## hosting with SSL. If you want to run multiple SSL servers with
## one lighttpd instance you must use IP-based virtual hosting: ::
##
## Mitigate CVE-2009-3555 by disabling client triggered renegotation
## This is enabled by default.
##
## IMPORTANT: this setting can only be used in the global scope.
## It does *not* work inside conditionals
##
#   ssl.disable-client-renegotiation = "enable"
##
##   $SERVER["socket"] == "10.0.0.1:443" {
##     ssl.engine                  = "enable"
##     ssl.pemfile                 = "/etc/ssl/private/www.example.com.pem"
##     #
##     # (Following SSL/TLS Deployment Best Practices 1.3 / 17 September 2013 from:
##     # https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/best-practices/index.html)
##     # - BEAST is considered mitigaed on client side now, and new weaknesses have been found in RC4,
##     #   so it is strongly advised to disable RC4 ciphers (HIGH doesn't include RC4)
##     # - It is recommended to disable 3DES too (although disabling RC4 and 3DES breaks IE6+8 on Windows XP,
##     #   so you might want to support 3DES for now - just remove the '!3DES' parts below).
##     # - The examples below prefer ciphersuites with "Forward Secrecy" (and ECDHE over DHE (alias EDH)), remove '+kEDH +kRSA'
##     #   if you don't want that.
##     # - SRP and PSK are not supported anyway, excluding those ('!kSRP !kPSK') just keeps the list smaller (easier to review)
##     # Check your cipher list with: openssl ciphers -v '...' (use single quotes as your shell won't like ! in double quotes)
##     #
##     # If you know you have RSA keys (standard), you can use:
##     ssl.cipher-list             = "PROFILE=SYSTEM"
##     # The more generic version (without the restriction to RSA keys) is
##     # ssl.cipher-list           = "HIGH !aNULL !3DES +kEDH +kRSA !kSRP !kPSK"
##     #
##     # Make the server prefer the order of the server side cipher suite instead of the client suite.
##     # This option is enabled by default, but only used if ssl.cipher-list is set.
##     #
##     # ssl.honor-cipher-order = "enable"
##     #
##     server.name                 = "www.example.com"
##
##     server.document-root        = "/srv/www/vhosts/example.com/www/"
##   }
##

## If you have a .crt and a .key file, cat them together into a
## single PEM file:
## $ cat /etc/ssl/private/lighttpd.key /etc/ssl/certs/lighttpd.crt \
##   > /etc/ssl/private/lighttpd.pem
##
#ssl.pemfile = "/etc/ssl/private/lighttpd.pem"

##
## optionally pass the CA certificate here.
##
##
#ssl.ca-file = ""

##
## and the CRL revocation list here.
##
##
#ssl.ca-crl-file = ""
